			<p>
				GTFS or the <em>General Transit Feed Specification</em> defines a common
				data format for public transportation schedules and associated
				geographic information. GTFS contains only static or scheduled
				information about public transport services, and is sometimes known as
				GTFS Static or GTFS Schedule to distinguish it from the GTFS Realtime
				extension, which defines how information on the realtime status of
				services can be shared.
			</p>

			<h3>Structure</h3>

			<p>
				A GTFS feed is a collection of at least six, and up to 13 CSV files
				(with extension .txt) contained within a .zip file. Preferred character
				encoding is UTF-8. Together, the related CSV tables describe a transit
				system's scheduled operations as visible to riders. The specification is
				designed to be sufficient to provide trip planning functionality, but is
				also useful for other applications such as analysis of service levels
				and some general performance measures. In contrast to European transit
				industry exchange standards such as Transmodel or VDV-45X, GTFS only
				includes scheduled operations that are meant to be distributed to
				riders. It is also limited to scheduled information and does not include
				real-time information. However, real-time information can be related to
				GTFS schedules according to the related GTFS Realtime specification.
			</p>
			<p>
				Following are descriptions of the tables required for a valid GTFS data
				feed. Each table is literally a text CSV file whose filename is the name
				of the table, suffixed by '.txt'. So for the 'agency' table below, a CSV
				file called 'agency.txt' would be included in a valid GTFS feed.
			</p>

			<h3>Mandatory tables</h3>

			<h4>agency</h4>
			<p>
				The agency table provides information about the transit agency as such,
				including name, website and contact information.
			</p>
			<p>Required fields:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>agency_name</li>
				<li>agency_url</li>
				<li>agency_timezone</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>routes</h4>
			<p>
				The routes table identifies distinct routes. This is to be distinguished
				from distinct routings (or paths), several of which may belong to a
				single route.
			</p>
			<p>Required fields:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>route_id (primary key)</li>
				<li>route_short_name</li>
				<li>route_long_name</li>
				<li>route_type</li>
				<li>background_color</li>
				<li>foreground_color</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>trips</h4>
			<p>Required fields:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>trip_id (primary key)</li>
				<li>route_id (foreign key)</li>
				<li>service_id (foreign key)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Optional fields:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					block_id - The block ID indicates the schedule block to which a trip
					belongs.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>stop_times</h4>
			<p>Required fields:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>stop_id (primary key)</li>
				<li>trip_id (foreign key)</li>
				<li>arrival_time</li>
				<li>departure_time</li>
				<li>stop_sequence</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Note that dwell time may be modelled by the difference between the
				arrival and departure times. However, many agencies do not seem to model
				dwell time for most stops.
			</p>

			<h4>stops</h4>
			<p>
				The stops table defines the geographic locations of each and every
				actual stop or station in the transit system as well as, and optionally,
				some of the amenities associated with those stops.
			</p>
			<p>Required fields:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>stop_id (primary key)</li>
				<li>stop_name</li>
				<li>stop_lon</li>
				<li>stop_lat</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>calendar</h4>
			<p>
				The calendar table defines service patterns that operate recurrently
				such as, for example, every weekday. Service patterns that don't repeat
				such as for a one-time special event will be defined in the
				calendar_dates table.
			</p>
			<p>Required fields:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>service_id (primary key)</li>
				<li>Monday</li>
				<li>Tuesday</li>
				<li>Wednesday</li>
				<li>Thursday</li>
				<li>Friday</li>
				<li>Saturday</li>
				<li>Sunday</li>
				<li>start_date</li>
				<li>end_date</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Optional tables</h3>

			<h4>calendar_dates</h4>
			<p>
				Calendar dates is an optional table which adds exceptions to the
				calendar.txt file. This can be adding additional days or removing days,
				such as for holiday service. The file only contains three columns, the
				service id, date, and exception type (either added or removed). A
				service id does not have to be inside the calendar.txt file to be added
				to this table.
			</p>

			<h4>fare_attributes</h4>

			<h4>fare_rules</h4>

			<h4>shapes</h4>
			<p>
				Rules for drawing lines on a map to represent a transit organization's
				routes.
			</p>

			<h4>frequencies</h4>
			<p>
				This table specifies headway (time between trips) for routes with
				variable frequency of service.
			</p>

			<h4>transfers</h4>
			<p>Rules for making connections at transfer points between routes.</p>

			<h4>feed_info</h4>
			<p>
				An optional feed start date and optional feed expiration date can be
				set. Agencies may publish feeds that are several days into the future.
				Thus, journey planning software applications keep multiple feed versions
				and the correct feed for a particular day or time.
			</p>

			<h4>translations</h4>
			<p>
				The translations table consists of the columns table_name, field_name,
				field_value, record_id, record_sub_id, language, translation.
				Translations are broken down into their respective tables, and any text
				field or URL may be translated. Translations in GTFS use two types of
				keys in the key-value table. Record_id uses ID for the field like
				stop_id or trip_id, while field_value is a matching value to the
				field_name's original contents. Tables using a two value tuple, such as
				stop_times, use record_id and record_sub_id to represent the tuple. The
				translation column is the output.

			<p>
				GTFS Realtime (also known as GTFS-rt) is an extension to GTFS, in which
				public transport agencies share real-time vehicle locations, arrival
				time predictions, and alerts such as detours and cancellations via
				Protocol Buffers web server.
			</p>
			<p>
				Realtime location data is created continuously by an agency from
				automatic vehicle location (AVL) systems. Trip arrival times are
				computed using machine learning models that analyse historical
				positional data and timetables.
			</p>

			<h3>Standard</h3>
			<p>
				The GTFS Realtime specification is defined by a .proto file hosted by
				Google. Data is serialized into raw bytes by the server and then
				deserialized by a client. Officially supported GTFS-rt binding libraries
				have been built in .NET, Java, Javascript, Python, and Go. Unofficial
				libraries have been written in other languages, such as Rust.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are currently three official feed types defined in the standard,
				TripUpdates, VehiclePositions, and Alerts. Shapes, Trip Modifications,
				and Stops are currently experimental.
			</p>
			<p>
				Agencies supporting GTFS-Realtime typically provide separate urls for
				the three separate feed types, and may choose to only provide some of
				the feeds. Unlike GTFS Static, many agencies may require developers to
				request an API key via email or a web form.
			</p>
			<p>
				Developers then write programs to periodically fetch an agency's web API
				over HTTP, typically every few seconds to minutes. Agencies typically
				refresh data in frequencies ranging between 1 second to 1 minute. There
				is no standard for streaming GTFS Realtime data, also support is built
				in to allow for deletion of items from previous iterations.
			</p>

			<h3>Trip updates</h3>
			<p>
				In the GTFS Specification, a trip refers to an operator driving a
				fixed-route vehicle from the start of the route to the end. A new trip
				is started for when the vehicle turns around at the end of its route.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Trip Update feed allows maps to show the departure or arrival times
				of vehicles, and allows routing algorithms to update their directions.
			</p>
			<p>
				This feed contains an array of Trip Updates. Each trip update enumerates
				a description of a trip (trip id, route id, start time and date,
				direction), last updated time, may include an associated vehicle number
				and route number, and contains an array of StopTimeUpdate. The
				StopTimeUpdate can define past, current, and future stop times, delays,
				and cancellations. The stop id references the GTFS Schedule feed the
				agency provides.
			</p>

			<h3>Vehicle positions</h3>
			<p>
				Vehicle Positions are sometimes shown on mapping applications to aid
				users in tracking the location of buses. This feed contains an array of
				VehiclePositions. Like Trip Updates, each VehiclePosition can also
				contain a basic description of the trip, such as its trip id, start and
				stop times, route number, and relationship to the schedule. The
				VehiclePosition also contains the current latitude and longitude of the
				vehicle, and can also include bearing, odometer, and speed in m/s.
				Finally, it can also contain information on how crowded the bus is,
				known as occupancy status, and status of road congestion experienced by
				the vehicle.
			</p>

			<h3>Alerts</h3>
			<p>
				Alerts can be shown to mapping application users to alert them of
				detours, cancellations, or other service changes. This feed contains an
				array of Alerts. Alerts typically don't update as often as Vehicle
				Positions or Trip Updates. Each Alert stores the cause (such as labour
				strike or a mechanical fault) of an incident, along with its effect
				(reduced service, detour, stop cancellation, etc.). Alerts also contain
				detailed headers, descriptions, urls, images, and a list of routes or
				stops affected (known as the Informed Entity). Alerts specify their
				beginning and expiration times using "active periods". Alerts can be
				localised into several languages.
